\title{
Fatigue crack growth in materials: Virkler dataset (tests 1 to 25)
}
\description{The data consist of an aluminum alloy specimen that was tested to investigate fatigue crack propagation.
Starting from an initial crack of length 9 mm for a particular item in test, the number of cycles for the size of the crack to reach a predetermined value was recorded successively. That is, it is registered the number of cycles every time an increment of size 0.2 mm in length occurs. The experiment finishes once a critical size of the crack is reached, meaning the failure of the item. The data were first published in Virkler et al. (1979) where
there were 68 specimens tested to grow the initial crack of 9 mm to the final crack of 50 mm. The first 25 tests are included.}
